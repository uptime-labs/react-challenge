# Pokémon React App Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Pokémon React App coding challenge! Your task is to create a simple React application that fetches and displays data from the PokéAPI.
This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills in React development, state management, API integration, and UX design.

## Requirements

Create a React application with the following features:

1. Fetch and display Pokémon data from the PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon)
2. Implement a search input that allows users to filter Pokémon by name
3. Display a list view of the filtered Pokémon data
4. Implement either pagination or infinite scrolling for the list
5. Include basic error handling and loading states
5. Implement a docker file to build the application with docker
6. A simple CI/CD pipeline to build and test the code

## Focus Areas

Please pay special attention to the following aspects:

- Clean, well-organized code
- Proper state management (using hooks, context, or a state management library of your choice)
- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Begin coding your solution in the provided project structure

## API Information

- Base URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/
- Pokémon endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
- For pagination, you can use the `limit` and `offset` query parameters

Example: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&offset=0`

## Submission

When you've completed the challenge:

1. Commit your changes to the main branch
2. Push your changes to your forked repository
3. Notify the interviewer that you've completed the challenge

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

- Functionality: Does the app meet all the requirements?
- Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-organized, and easy to understand?
- State Management: Is state managed effectively and appropriately?
- UI/UX: Is the interface intuitive and responsive?
- Error Handling: Are errors handled gracefully?
- Bonus: Any additional features or improvements you add will be considered

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your solution!
